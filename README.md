FSM with State Diagram and Properties (May 2020)

The State Diagram and Property Checker are plugins that work with execution traces generated by JIVE: www.cse.buffalo.edu/jive.
State diagrams are simple data-oriented finite state machines based upon key attributes of a Java program,
chosen by the user. Properties are similar to those of propositional temporal logic, but focus mainly on
safety properties.  In the Readers-Writers program, for example, where r = number of running readers and w =
the number of running writers,  the controller for readers and writers should satisfy:

G [								// means that all states should satisfy: <br/> 
    (r > 0 -> w = 0) &&            // no writers run when reads are in progress    <br/>
    (w > 0  -> r = 0) &&           // no readers run when writes are in progress   <br/>
    (w = 0 || w = 1)               // at most one write operation at a time        <br/>
  ]
